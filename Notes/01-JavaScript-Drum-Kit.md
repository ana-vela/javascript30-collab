# Notes

## Error logging `audio[data-key=65]`
In the tutorial, he tries to log the HTML audio element using  the `audio[data-key=65]` selector (6' 30"), 
which only works when he adds quotes to the number.
If I'm not mistaken, that's because, at first, the engine interprets the attribute as a number and later, adding quotes, as a string.
