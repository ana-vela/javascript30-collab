- [3'18"] Nice to have: use parent element to target children classes
- [4'35"] Page reflow after positioning change on the nav element + fix
- [8'00"] _"You cannot animate the `width` property but you can animate `max-width`"_.
   Actually now you can as per [Animatable CSS properties - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties "Animatable CSS properties - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN") and has shown in this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/adrianskar/pen/ZEqzWvB) but it won't work with `flex` positioned items so the same code still applies for this page.
